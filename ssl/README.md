# README for Nginx and Certbot Reverse Proxy Setup

## Install
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgm-labs/scripts/main/ssl/run.sh)
```

## Introduction

This script automates the setup and management of a reverse proxy configuration using Nginx and Certbot. It allows you to easily configure multiple domains and subdomains with SSL support, routing traffic to different containers based on domain and port configurations.

## Features

- **Automatic installation** of Nginx and Certbot.
- **Reverse proxy configuration** for multiple domains and subdomains.
- **SSL certificate management** using Let's Encrypt via Certbot.
- **Automatic SSL renewal** management.
- **Support for dynamic port and domain configurations**.

## Configuration File

The configuration file is a JSON file that specifies the email for SSL certificate registration and a list of domains with their associated ports. Here is an example configuration:

```json
{
    "email": "tgm.bet@outlook.com",
    "domains": [
        {
            "domain": "tgm.bet",
            "external_port": 80,
            "container_port": 8080
        },
        {
            "domain": "tgm.bet",
            "external_port": 7080,
            "container_port": 8081
        },
        {
            "domain": "api.tgm.bet",
            "external_port": 80,
            "container_port": 8071
        }
    ]
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Domain**: The domain or subdomain for which the reverse proxy is configured.
- **External Port**: The port on the server that listens for incoming traffic. **Domains must have unique external ports** to avoid conflicts.
- **Container Port**: The port on the container or backend service to which the traffic is forwarded.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing the script:

```bash
git clone https://your-repo-url
cd your-repo-directory
```

### 2. Set Up the Configuration File

Create or edit your configuration file as shown above. If using a remote configuration file, update the script to point to your fileâ€™s URL.

### 3. Run the Script

The script provides a menu for various operations. Run the script as follows:

```bash
./nginx_certbot_setup.sh
```

### 4. Menu Options

The script will display a menu with options depending on whether Nginx and Certbot are already installed.

- **Install Nginx and Certbot**: Installs the necessary software if not already installed.
- **Add Reverse Proxy**: Configures reverse proxy settings for the domains listed in your configuration file.
- **Remove Reverse Proxy**: Removes a reverse proxy configuration.
- **Remove Certbot and Nginx**: Completely removes Nginx and Certbot from your system.
- **Manage SSL Auto-Renewal**: Enables or disables automatic SSL renewal.

### 5. Important Notes

- **Port Conflicts**: If multiple domains share the same external port, they must be distinct domains (e.g., `tgm.bet` and `api.tgm.bet`). If the domain is the same, ensure that each uses a unique external port (e.g., `80` and `7080` for `tgm.bet`).
- **SSL Certificates**: The script automatically obtains and renews SSL certificates using the email provided in the configuration file.

### 6. Example Scenario

For the provided configuration, the script will:

- Create a reverse proxy for `tgm.bet` on external port `80`, routing to `8080`.
- Create a reverse proxy for `tgm.bet` on external port `7080`, routing to `8081`.
- Create a reverse proxy for `api.tgm.bet` on external port `80`, routing to `8082`.

In this scenario, `tgm.bet` uses two different external ports (`80` and `7080`) for two services, while `api.tgm.bet` can share the external port `80` with `tgm.bet` since it is a different subdomain.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nginx Configuration Errors**: If Nginx fails to reload after applying configurations, review the error messages and check for port conflicts or syntax errors in the configuration files.
- **SSL Certificate Issues**: If Certbot fails to obtain an SSL certificate, ensure that your domain's DNS is correctly configured and that the domain points to your server's IP address.
